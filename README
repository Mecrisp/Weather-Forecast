A particle simulator running in 512 bytes on RISC-V RV32IMC

Weather forecast is designed for GD32VF103 microcontrollers and
draws vector graphics on an analog oscilloscope in XY mode
connected to

   GND and the two DAC channels on pins
   PA4 (vertical) and
   PA5 (horizontal).

At the beginning, a sun is displayed, which bursts into many drops
when rain touches the sun. Waves and spray fill the canvas,
and you can observe intermittent rainfall and forming of clouds.

Weather Forecast implements a "smoothed particle hydrodynamics" simulation
using carefully scaled fixpoint integers only.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothed-particle_hydrodynamics

Every particle has force, velocity and position vectors,
a temperature and a wall flag and its behaviour is simulated by numerically
integrating newtons laws of motion for all pairs of particles, taking
collisions, viscosity, temperature, and gravity into account.

The particle table is filled with an old, but obscure "Mandala" algorithm:
Rotations of pixels by fractional angles in closed cycles on integer coordinates
sometimes result in long, interesting and artistic curves.
Proof-of-concept Mandala algorithm code for Gforth is included
for further exploration.

Rainfall is implemented by directly setting the y-coordinates of particles
to the top of the image in a pattern derived by shifting from the frame counter,
clearing the wall flag of the choosen particle along with the move.

At the beginning, all particles are flagged as "wall", being immobile.
Collisions with movable particles clear the wall flag, so the sun bursts on
first contact with rain.

A Minsky circle algorithm updates sine and cosine values, which are
- depending on frame counter - fed along with gravity as initial values
into the force integrals of the particle simulator to cause waves and clouds.

All other visible effects result from the physics
simulation running on these inputs.

  How to run:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have connected your

Longan Nano board to
             a USB-serial cable with 3.3V logic levels

3V3 or 5V -- VCC (measure the voltage present here)
R0        -- TXD
T0        -- RXD
GND       -- GND

you can flash it if you first

* Press and hold BOOT0 button
* Press and release Reset button
* Release BOOT0 button

and then execute

stm32loader -e -w -v -p /dev/ttyUSB0 weather-forecast.bin

on your host machine.

Press and release Reset button to start demo.


PS: There is also a version for Linux with qemu-user-static
    that uses a mmap'ed 1920x1080x32bpp framebuffer through syscalls
    so that you can at least try the effects of Weather Forecast
    on your desktop machine.
